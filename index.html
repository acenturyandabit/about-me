            <h1>Job: Matrix Education</h1>
            <p>
              I've worked at Matrix Education as a Math tutor since 2018. My job
              involves helping students to solve their problems one-on-one, as
              well as ensuring I complete the marking allocation I am assinged
              each week.
            </p>
            <p>
              My primary achievement is obtaining a 4.9+/5 in our WEQ
              performance metric based on being friendly, goal-oriented,
              professional and good communicators.

            <h1>Extracurricular: USYD RobotX</h1>
            <p>
              I've been working with the USYD RobotX team since mid-2018. I
              started as a Computer vision specialist, learning how to work with
              a new operating system, a new framework, and microprocessors I
              hadn't encountered before, all in the space of a few months.
              Currently my role there involves managing the low-level code and
              progression of critical systems so the rest of the team can have a
              reliable platform to build upon.

            <h1>Project: PEP ++</h1>
            <p>
              At the University of Sydney, as an engineer I have to engage with
              the Professional Engagement Program (PEP) which aims to facilitate
              skill-building activities. For us students as users, there were
              many areas we felt could be improved. After collecting those areas
              and contacting Anthony Kadi, the person in charge of the program,
              I felt that I could directly resolve some of the issues by
              constructing a user interface addition called PEP ++.
            </p>
            <p>
              PEP++ drew on my ability to take an existing product and improve
              it to better address the needs of the customers, whilst retaining
              the original functionality of the program.

              I'm currently a member of the USYD Leadership Scholars, a group of
              students chosen for our ability to lead and inspire others.
              Through the leadership scholarship I've travelled overseas to
              engage with students at the Penn State University to engage with
              an international project developing an aquaponics sensor platform
              to be used in Pretoria, Africa.

            <h1>Skill: Web development</h1>
            <p>
              I've been developing for the web since 2018, but my extensive
              programming experience means I've gotten a lot done since then.
              I've embraced the Progressive Web App movement which allows
              developers to quickly build cross-platform user interfaces. I've
              built my own Javascript modular framework to speed up the
              development process without having to depend on an opaque
              frameworks with extensive overhead.
            </p>
            <p>
              My opus magnum in this sphere is
              <a href="acenturyandabit.github.io/polymorph">Polymorph</a>: a
              hyper-flexible user interface geared towards modularity and
              customisability.

            <h1>Skill: Robotics engineering</h1>
            <p>
              I'm currently studying a double degree with Mechatronics Engineer
              at the University of Sydney. I first started robotics in 2012 upon
              starting high school and have been passionate about it ever since.
              My robotics experience helps me adapt to a variety of electrical
              and mechanical engineering problems, as well as giving me
              systems-level insight into problems I face.
            </p>
            <p>
              My opus magnum in this sphere is with the USYD RobotX program,

              platforms.

              My experience in this field is guiding the development of

            <p>
              I'm currently in my 2nd year of university, so I've certainly got
              a way to go until I graduate. That being said, I'm passionate
              about quite a few things which gives me a sense of direction when
              choosing where to go.

            <h1>Passion: Primary Sector Renewability</h1>
            <p>
              I believe the human race is capable of progressing into the future
              sustainably without compromising our standard of living. This
              could only be achieved by developing and implementing renewable
              resource streams. Only if we can do this in a scalable manner will
              we be able to pursue longer term goals such as increased world
              stability, a world free from disease, and space exploration.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are many ways that I see myself going about this, whether
              it's working with AI and NLP to analyse data and identify
              opportunities for resource recycling, or engineering scalability
              and reliability into the latest scientific advances.

            <h1>Passion: Strategy</h1>
            <p>
              Our consciousness enables us to plan far into the future and I
              believe that we should utilise this in everything that we do. I
              strongly appreciate responsive, self-aware organisations which
              have a vision and a well-thought-out means of achieving it.
            </p>
            <p>
              I feel like as a society we arm ourselves with tools to deal with
              the short term rather than the long term. I want to change this by
              helping develop new ways of conceptualising and planning ideas to
              facilitate strategic thinking.

            <h1>Passion: Robotics and automation</h1>
            <p>
              As humans one of our defining features is our culture, founded
              upon self-expression and art. If we constrain people into
              repetitive tasks that really could be done by a robot, we are
              putting a cap on our abilities as a species. This is why I'm
              passionate about robotics - not only as a means to be more
              efficient, but also as a pathway for us as a species to become
              better than we are today.
            </p>
            <p>
              I would love to take part in a project which aims to bring down
              the cost of robotics whilst increasing its capabilities so that
              robotics becomes a part of our everyday life which we can depend
              on to get basic things done without much intervention.
